# Server Side Rendering with Angular

## What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where a web application's HTML content is generated on the server and sent to the client, as opposed to client-side rendering (CSR), where the content is rendered in the browser using JavaScript after the initial HTML file is loaded. SSR is particularly beneficial for single-page applications (SPAs), like those built with Angular, because it improves performance and SEO.

In traditional client-side rendering (CSR), a blank HTML page is sent to the browser, and JavaScript code is executed on the client side to build the page. SSR, on the other hand, generates the HTML on the server, sends it to the client, and then Angular takes over to handle any further interactions (this process is known as hydration).

## Why Do We Use Server-Side Rendering?
### 1. Improved SEO:
- Search engines like Google, Bing, and others rely on web crawlers to index pages. With CSR, crawlers might receive a blank page if they don't execute JavaScript properly, leading to poor SEO. SSR helps in delivering fully rendered HTML to the crawlers, improving the chances of better indexing and ranking.
### 2. Faster First Page Load:
- SSR allows the initial content to be displayed faster since the server sends the fully-rendered HTML to the client. This reduces the time it takes for users to see content, leading to a better user experience.
### 3. Better Social Media Sharing:
- When sharing links on social media platforms, these platforms often extract meta tags to generate previews. With CSR, these meta tags might not be available during the initial load. SSR ensures that these meta tags are included in the HTML, improving social sharing previews.
### 4. Progressive Enhancement:
- SSR ensures that users can still view and interact with the content even if JavaScript is disabled or doesn't load correctly. This enhances the robustness and accessibility of the application.

### Example: Setting Up SSR with Angular Universal

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Angular involves using Angular Universal, a technology that allows Angular applications to be rendered on the server. This can improve the application's performance and SEO by serving the initial view of the page directly from the server.

### Here's how you can create a basic Angular SSR project and set up SSR with Angular Universal:

### 1. Install Angular CLI
Make sure we have Angular CLI installed globally. If we don’t have it, we can install it using:
```console
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
### 2. Create a New Angular Project
Create a new Angular project by running:
```console
ng new angular-server-side-rendering
cd angular-server-side-rendering
```
### 3. Add Angular Universal to Your Project
We can add Angular Universal to our existing Angular project by running the following command:
```console
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine
```
This command will configure our project for SSR, including adding the necessary server-side files and dependencies.
### 4. Build the Angular Application for SSR
After adding Angular Universal, we can build the application for SSR using:
```console
npm run build:ssr
```
This will build the client and server bundles needed to run the application on the server.
### 5. Serve the Application on the Server
To serve our SSR-enabled Angular application, run:
```console
npm run serve:ssr
```
This will start an Express server that serves our Angular application with SSR.
### 6. Test SSR
After running the server, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000. You should see your Angular application, and if you inspect the page source, you’ll see that the HTML is fully rendered on the server side.


## How SSR Works in Angular:
### 1.Initial Server-Side Rendering:
- When a user requests a page, the Angular Universal server generates the HTML on the server and sends it to the client.
- The user immediately sees the fully rendered HTML content.

### 2.Client-Side Hydration:
- After the initial HTML is loaded, Angular's JavaScript takes over, making the application interactive. This process is called hydration.
- Angular restores the state of the application on the client side, allowing for smooth interaction.

## Pros and Cons of SSR
### Pros:
#### 1. Improved SEO:
- Fully-rendered HTML sent to the client ensures better indexing by search engines.
#### 2. Faster Initial Load:
- The initial page load is faster since the server sends rendered HTML instead of waiting for JavaScript to build the page on the client side.
#### 3.Better User Experience:
- Users see content faster, leading to improved perceived performance and a better overall experience.
#### 4.Enhanced Social Media Sharing:
- Social media platforms get the correct meta tags for previews, improving the shareability of content.
#### 5.Progressive Enhancement:
- The application works even if JavaScript fails or is disabled.
### Cons:
#### 1.Increased Server Load:
- Since the server must render each page, it can increase server load, especially with many users. This can lead to scalability concerns.
#### 2.Complexity:
- SSR adds complexity to the project, requiring more configuration and code to handle both server-side and client-side rendering.
#### 3.Development and Debugging Challenges:
- Debugging SSR issues can be more challenging because errors can occur on both the client and server sides.
#### 4. Potential Performance Bottlenecks:
- If not optimized, SSR can introduce latency because the server must generate the HTML before sending it to the client.
#### 5.Cache Management:
- Caching strategies for SSR applications need to be carefully managed to avoid sending stale content or overloading the server with redundant rendering tasks.

### When to Use SSR?
**SEO-Focused Applications:** If your application needs to be indexed well by search engines (e.g., blogs, e-commerce sites).
**Performance-Sensitive Apps:** For applications where initial load time is critical (e.g., news sites, landing pages).
**Social Media-Heavy Apps:** If your application heavily relies on social media sharing, SSR ensures that correct metadata is provided.

### Conclusion
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Angular using Angular Universal provides significant benefits in terms of SEO, performance, and user experience. However, it comes with added complexity and potential performance challenges on the server side. It’s essential to weigh the pros and cons based on your application's requirements and decide whether SSR is the right choice for your project.
